## The Purpose of the new analysis is well defined
# That assigment want to find date, type, counts in the graph. Also, they want to make chart with three trends to see increase or decrease from beginner to end.

# average fare per driver: Rural 55.49, suburban 39.50, Urban 16.57
# total fare by city type: Rural 440, Suburban 1450, Urban 2250
### Summary
# Three of Rural, Suburban, and Urban are very good but Rural is low because country and not much popualtions live there. I would to recommend to no need focus in rural and more foucs in Urban and Suburban because the proof is both increase at the end and tend growth popualtions so which increase fare.

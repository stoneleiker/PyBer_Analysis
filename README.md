# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview

# This analysis seeks to provide insights into ride accessibility and affordability for PyBer, a Python-based ride-sharing app company. Our goal is to perform exploratory data analysis on a large dataset to determine the relationship between the type of city, the number of drivers and riders, and the percentage of total fares, riders, and drivers by type of city. To achieve this goal, We would create several visualizations, write python scripts using pandas library and Matplotlib to create various charts. In the end, we hope to use the analysis and visualizations we produce to improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

# After creating initial results, our analysis moves to a second phase where we make a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, we would create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, we would summarize how the data differs by city type and how decision-makers can use those differences at PyBer to answer questions around ride accessibility and affordability.
